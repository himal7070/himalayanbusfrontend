# Himalayan Bus

## 1. Goal of the project

The goal of the **bus tickets reservation system** (“Himalayan Bus”) project is to create an efficient online platform for booking and purchasing bus tickets. This project aims to provide customers with a user-friendly experience, optimize the bus service provider's operations, and generate revenue by leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The system adds value by enhancing customer satisfaction, improving efficiency, and fostering data-driven decision-making, all while positioning the company as a competitive and customer-centric service provider. 

## 1.2 Scope and preconditions

### 1.2.1 Inside Scope:

- **User Profile Management:** Within the project's scope, user profile management includes user registration, login, and basic user information maintenance. Users can update their personal details, view their booking history, and reset their passwords.

- **Bus Route and Schedule Management:** The project includes features that allow administrators to manage bus details, such as Bus Name, Bus Route, Bus Type (AC/non-AC), seats, departure time, and arrival time. Admins can also manage the available routes.

- **Feedback and Reviews:** Gathering and displaying user feedback and reviews for bus journeys is part of the project's scope. Users can provide feedback on their travel experiences, and this information will be accessible to other users for reference.

### 1.2.2 Outside Scope:

- **Payment Gateway Integration:** The integration of specific payment gateways for processing ticket payments is typically outside the initial project scope. This integration involves financial transactions and requires careful consideration of security and compliance.

- **Real-Time Bus Tracking:** Implementing real-time tracking of buses and providing live updates on bus locations and delays is typically a complex and resource-intensive feature that is often considered for future enhancements rather than the initial project.

- **Advanced Analytics and Reporting:** In-depth analytics and reporting functionalities, such as complex data analysis, revenue forecasting, or route optimization based on historical data, may fall outside the initial project scope. These advanced features often require more extensive development and data processing.
